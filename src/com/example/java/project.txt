Project: Library Management System (Basic)
Goal: Create a simple system to manage books and users.
Requirements:
1. Define a Book class with attributes like title,
    author, and ISBN, and a User class with attributes like name and ID.
2. Implement a Library class that contains an ArrayList of books
    and provides methods to add, view, and check out books.
3. Use encapsulation to make fields private and provide getters/setters for access.
4. If comfortable, create two user types (e.g., Student and Teacher)
    that inherit from User to practice inheritance.
Expected Outcome: Youâ€™ll get a deep understanding of OOP principles, including classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
